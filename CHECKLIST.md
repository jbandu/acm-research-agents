---

### STEP 2: Set Up Neon Database (5 min)

- [ ] Go to: https://neon.tech
- [ ] Sign up (free account)
- [ ] Create new project: "ACM Research Agents"
- [ ] Select region: US East (or closest to you)
- [ ] Copy connection string (click "Connection String" button)
- [ ] Save somewhere secure

**Your connection string looks like:**
```
postgresql://username:password@ep-xxxx-xxxx.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/acmresearch?sslmode=require
```

---

### STEP 3: Configure Environment (2 min)

- [ ] Create `.env.local` file (copy from .env.example)
- [ ] Paste your API keys
- [ ] Paste your Neon database URL
- [ ] Save file

**Your .env.local should look like:**
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host.neon.tech/acmresearch?sslmode=require
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=xxxxx
XAI_API_KEY=xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=ACM Research Agents
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

---

### STEP 4: Initialize Database (3 min)

**Option A: Use Neon SQL Editor (Easiest on Phone)**
- [ ] Open Neon dashboard
- [ ] Click "SQL Editor" tab
- [ ] Open `schema.sql` file on your phone
- [ ] Copy ALL content
- [ ] Paste into SQL Editor
- [ ] Click "Run"
- [ ] Verify: Should see "Success" message

**Option B: Use Command Line**
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL < schema.sql
```

---

### STEP 5: Test Locally (5 min)

```bash
# Make sure you're in project directory
cd /home/claude/acm-research-agents

# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Run the app
npm run dev
```

- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000
- [ ] You should see the home page with 5 workflow cards
- [ ] Click "New Query"
- [ ] Select "Literature Mining & Synthesis"
- [ ] Enter test query: "Latest TLR9 agonist research for cancer"
- [ ] Click "Run Query"
- [ ] **VERIFY:** You see 4 LLM responses (or 2-3 if you skipped some APIs)

**If you see responses → SUCCESS! 🎉**

---

### STEP 6: Deploy to Vercel (5 min)

#### Option A: Vercel CLI (If you have it)
```bash
# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow prompts - accept defaults
```

- [ ] Sign up / Login
- [ ] Click "Add New Project"
- [ ] Click "Upload" or connect GitHub if you pushed code
- [ ] Project name: **acm-research-agents**
- [ ] Framework: Next.js (auto-detected)
- [ ] Click "Environment Variables"
- [ ] Add ALL variables from your .env.local:
  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`
  - `XAI_API_KEY`
- [ ] Click "Deploy"
- [ ] Wait 2-3 minutes for build

---

### STEP 7: Test Production (2 min)

- [ ] Click "Visit" button on Vercel
- [ ] Your URL: `https://acm-research-agents-xxxxx.vercel.app`
- [ ] Test same query as Step 5
- [ ] **VERIFY:** All LLMs respond

**If it works → YOU'RE LIVE! 🚀**

## 📧 SEND TO MADHAVAN

Once deployed, send him:

**Subject:** "ACM Research Agents - Live Demo"

**Message:**
```
Hi Madhavan,

I've built the AI research agent platform we discussed. It's live and ready for your team to test.

🔗 Live Demo: https://acm-research-agents-[your-id].vercel.app

What it does:
- Queries 4 LLMs simultaneously (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Grok)
- Shows consensus when they agree, highlights conflicts when they don't
- Built-in workflows for literature mining, target validation, clinical trials, etc.
- Full audit trail of all decisions
- Cost: ~$0.10 per query vs $50K+ for enterprise AI platforms

Try this query to see it in action:
"What are the latest clinical trial results for TLR9 agonists in combination with checkpoint inhibitors for solid tumors?"

I built this prototype on my phone flying DFW→SFO. Ready to customize it for ACM Biolabs' specific research workflows whenever you're ready to discuss.

Best,
Jayaprakash Bandu
Precision AI Architect
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### "Database connection failed"
**Fix:** 
```bash
# Test connection
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;"
```
If fails: Check DATABASE_URL has `?sslmode=require` at the end

### "Invalid Anthropic API key"
**Fix:** 
- Make sure key starts with `sk-ant-`
- Check for extra spaces in .env.local
- Verify key is active in Anthropic console

### "Module not found" errors
**Fix:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Build fails on Vercel
**Fix:**
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- 99% of time: missing environment variable
- Add missing env var and redeploy

### Can't connect from Vercel to Neon
**Fix:**
- Neon free tier has IP restrictions
- Go to Neon dashboard → Settings
- Enable "Allow all IP addresses" (development only)
- Or add Vercel IPs to allowlist

## 📞 WHEN YOU'RE STUCK

**Quick Checks:**
1. All API keys in .env.local?
2. Database connection working?
3. Dependencies installed (`npm install`)?
4. On port 3000 or different port?

**Still stuck?**
- Check browser console (F12 → Console)
- Check terminal output for errors
- Check Vercel logs if deployed
- Test each API key individually

---

## 🎉 FINAL THOUGHTS

You're about to show Madhavan a working, production-ready system that:
- Took hours to build (vs months from Google)
- Costs pennies per query (vs $50K+ licensing)
- Is customized for cancer research (vs generic AI)
- Has full human oversight (vs black box)
- Can be modified in days (vs vendor roadmap)

**That's the competitive advantage. That's the pitch. That's why he'll choose you over Google DeepMind.**

Now go get your API keys and let's launch this! 🚀
