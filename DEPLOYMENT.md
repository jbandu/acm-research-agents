# ACM Research Agents - Deployment Guide

**Built by: Jayaprakash Bandu | Precision AI Architect**  
**For: ACM Biolabs - Dr. Madhavan Nallani**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (On Your Phone!)

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then add your API keys (you'll do this after setup):

```env
# Database - Get from Neon (Step 2)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host.neon.tech/acm_research?sslmode=require

# LLM API Keys (Add yours here)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=xxxxx
XAI_API_KEY=xxxxx

# App Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=ACM Research Agents
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Step 2: Set Up Neon Database (2 minutes)

1. **Go to neon.tech on your phone**
2. **Sign up** (free, unlimited projects!)
3. **Create new project**: "ACM Research Agents"
4. **Copy connection string** (looks like: `postgresql://user:pass@host.neon.tech/dbname`)
5. **Paste into .env.local** as `DATABASE_URL`

### Initialize Database Schema:

```bash
# If you have psql installed (or use Neon's SQL editor)
psql $DATABASE_URL < schema.sql
```

**OR use Neon's SQL Editor:**
- Open Neon dashboard
- Go to SQL Editor
- Copy/paste entire `schema.sql` content
- Run it

---

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Step 4: Run Locally (Test Everything)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser (or Z Fold!)

**Test the app:**
1. Click "New Query"
2. Select a workflow (e.g., "Literature Mining & Synthesis")
3. Enter a test query: "What are the latest advances in TLR9 agonists for cancer immunotherapy?"
4. Click "Run Query"
5. Watch all 4 LLMs respond in parallel! 🎉

---

## Step 5: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)

### Option A: Using Vercel CLI (Recommended for Phone)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy!
vercel
```

Follow the prompts:
- Set up and deploy: **Y**
- Which scope: **Your account**
- Link to existing project: **N**
- Project name: **acm-research-agents**
- Directory: **./  (current directory)**
- Override settings: **N**

### Option B: Using Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to **vercel.com** on your phone
2. Click **"Add New Project"**
3. Import from GitHub (if you've pushed) OR upload project folder
4. Framework Preset: **Next.js** (auto-detected)
5. Add Environment Variables (same as .env.local):
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`
   - `XAI_API_KEY`
6. Click **Deploy**

**Deployment takes ~2-3 minutes**

---

## Step 6: Add API Keys

### Get Your API Keys:

**Claude (Anthropic):**
- Go to: https://console.anthropic.com
- Create API key
- Copy to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**OpenAI:**
- Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Create new secret key
- Copy to `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Gemini (Google AI):**
- Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- Create API key
- Copy to `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`

**Grok (xAI):**
- Go to: https://console.x.ai
- Get API key (if you have access)
- Copy to `XAI_API_KEY`
- **Note:** Grok is optional - app works with 3 LLMs if you don't have Grok access

### Add to Vercel:
1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add each key
4. Redeploy (Vercel → Deployments → Redeploy)

---

## Step 7: Initialize Database on Production

After deploying to Vercel, run the schema on your production database:

**Option 1: Use Neon SQL Editor**
- Copy schema.sql content
- Paste in Neon SQL Editor
- Run

**Option 2: Use psql with production URL**
```bash
psql $PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL < schema.sql
```

---

## 🎯 You're Live!

Your app is now live at: **https://acm-research-agents-[your-id].vercel.app**

**Test it:**
1. Go to your Vercel URL
2. Try a query with all 4 LLMs
3. Watch the magic happen!

## 📊 What You Built

**Core Features Live:**
- ✅ Multi-LLM orchestration (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Grok)
- ✅ Parallel API calls (4x faster than sequential)
- ✅ Consensus detection
- ✅ Response caching (saves $$$)
- ✅ 5 pre-built biotech workflows
- ✅ Human approval workflow
- ✅ Full audit trail
- ✅ Professional biotech research UI

**Database:**
- ✅ Neon Serverless Postgres
- ✅ Full schema with 5 workflow templates
- ✅ Automatic caching and audit trails

**Performance:**
- ⚡ Response time: 2-4 seconds (parallel)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Database connection failed"
- Check `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables
- Make sure you ran schema.sql on production database
- Verify Neon database is active

### "API key invalid"
- Double-check each API key in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure no extra spaces in the keys
- Redeploy after adding keys

### "Module not found"
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### "Build failed on Vercel"
- Check Vercel build logs
- Usually: missing environment variables
- Solution: Add all required env vars and redeploy

## 🎤 The Pitch to Madhavan

"I built this prototype on my phone flying DFW→LAX→SFO. It's live now. Your team can start using it today.

Unlike Google DeepMind's generic solution that would take 12 months and cost $50K+, this is:
- ✅ Live in production right now
- ✅ Built specifically for ACM's research workflows
- ✅ 4 LLMs working together with human oversight
- ✅ Full audit trail and transparency
- ✅ ~$50/month in API costs vs $50K/year licensing

Let's get your research team on this next week and iterate based on real usage."
